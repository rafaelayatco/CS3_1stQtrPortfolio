# Q1 End of Lessons Reflections
### By Rafaela Yatco, 9-Beryllium 


## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.
1. **Java Script Overviw and Syntax** - This topic was easy to understand because it was more on the background and concept of the programming languange itself. I was able to learn it very well because the topic centers more on the history of the creation of JavaScript and its rules rather than coding itself. It also introduced the very basic concepts like embedding the script element, so there were no heavy sub-topics discussed yet making it very easy for me to understand. Additionally, the syntax of JavaScript was similar to the one's in C++ and even Python so I had prior knowledge already on the topic.
2. **Java Script Basic Statements** - This topic focused on the basic output and input statements to be used in JavaScript. It introduced statements such as console.log(), document.write(),and alert() for output, while the input statement was using a confirm() box. We had many exercises in class that used these statements already so it was easy to learn it since it was integrated with our discussions since the beginning. 
3. **Variable Declaration** - This discussed how variables are declaredd in JavaScript including its keywords such as var, let, and const. It also talked about the different data types in variables, even introducing new ones that I have not encountered beore which are null and symbol. This topic was something I know very well because I had prior knowledge about it back in CS2. All the exercises we do are always using variables so over time I learned them very well. 
4. **Control Structures** - The control structures topic described focused on if, if else, else, switch and an introduction to loops. I already had prior knowledge to these topics since they are similar with C++. We also had enough exercises in the past school year to make me understand on how to use them.  
5. **JavaScipt Operations** - The topic discussed about the different types of operators such as arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, and assignment operators. The operators used in JavaScript are similar with C++ so we have prior knowledge already.  We also had enough exercises the past school years to make me understand on how to use them.  

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
1. **Loop Control Structures (while, do..while, for..in)** - This topics discusses the logic and syntax on the different loops such as while, do while, and for loops. I would need more practice in how to apply the logic for the program as an actual code. I have difficulty in translating my ideas for the program into actual loops itself. 
2. **Loop Control Structures (break, continue, Nested Loop)** - As a sub-topic under loop structures stated above, I have a problem in knowing when to apply these statements. I do get them conceptually like how the break statement exits the loop, the continue statement prevents the eecution of the current iteration, and nested loops are loops within loops. My main difficulty is in regards on how to execute these statements with a certain problem description. 
3. **Declaring Functions** - This topic focuses the different ways to declare a function. I've had experiences with coding using fuctions in CS2 but like in loops I struggle to interpret my logic into a code. The declaration is also a bit different from the one I was familiar with in C++. Additionally, the function as an expression and how can it be used is quite confusing for me. 
4. **Commonly Used JavaScript Number Objects** - This topic is easy for me to understand since it justs focuses on number properties. I believe I just need more practice with this since we have not yet used these concepts in coding that much. 
5. **Processing Function Output** - I generally know this topic well since it just uses input, output, and return stataements. The main struggle I encounter is how to use this since it is related with declaring functions. 

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

1. I will create a study schedule, reserving time to review and catch-up on the topics I'm falling behind on. I will re-read the guides posted in Khub. 
2. I will utilize online resources such as Khan Academy and W3 Schools as additional guides. These would be a supplement to the discussions in class.  
3. When I do not understand a topic, I would consult with my teacher. This will avoid confusion in the long run and help me correct the misconceptions or mistakes I made.
4. I would practice on hands-on actovities like coding exercises every weekend. This will help me train myself to code a problem statement accurately and efficiently.
5. I would ask my classmates who understand the topic well for group study sessions. This would help me grow and learn together with my peers.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

**Effective:**
1. I believe that the coding exercises given are effective since it gives opputunities for us to develop and apply our analytical skills and coding skills. It also helps us to practice for future assesments both practical and conceptual. 
2. I believe that the speed tests done in class are effective as well. It helps trains us to code quickly and accurately which would be very helpful for time constraint assesments such as the long tests. Not only does it give it bonuses to people who finish the fastest, but it engages the class and encourages them to make an effort in coding. 

**Not Effective:**
1. I believe that some Kahoot games we do in class are not effective. They are very convienient when learning about conceptual topics however there ae certain instances where it lags and time runs out for students to answer. Sometimes students can also just guess the options due to the time pressure. It would be more effective if students were sent  copy of the kahoot games so they can use those to review later on. 
2. The class coding discussions for me are a bit ineffective. Sometimes the discussions would go too fast and I cannot catch up. Since these discussions are after in-class coding exercises, the codes presented on teh screen are not exact or similar with mine. I do know this is because the code presented is an alternative but most of the time it makes me more confused.
